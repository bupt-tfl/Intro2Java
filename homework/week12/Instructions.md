## Homework 12 - Week 12 (optional)

### Motivation
* Demonstrate your ability to program using Java 8 paradigms

### Instructions
* Your task is to convert Java OO style code into Java functional style code.
    - There are two classes to modify.  The [Conversions](src/main/java/edu/nyu/cs9053/homework12/Conversions.java) and [VehicleMakeFilterer](src/main/java/edu/nyu/cs9053/homework12/VehicleMakeFilterer.java)
        - The `Conversions` is to demonstrate your ability to convert pre-Java8 code to Java8 code
        - The `VehicleMakeFilterer` will use Java 8's notion of `Optional`

## Grade
* This assignment (keep in mind it's optional) will be worth 5 points extra on the final exam.  I.e., if you complete this assignment and get all 5 points you will receive an extra 5 points on your final exam (meaning, if you were to miss 5 points on the final exam you would still get 100%)

### Implementation
* Ensure your code is correct by compiling and testing it
* Your code should not have any compiler warnings (and you should not suppress them)
* A portion of your grade will be based upon readability and organization of your code.
    - Follow the naming guidelines of lecture
    - Break large functions into multiple functions based on logical organizations
